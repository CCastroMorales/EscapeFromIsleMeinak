scene.title EXT. GAS STATION - DAWN
scene.scriptBegin

You're at the gas station by the village outskirts. Station might be an overstatement as it is just a rusty tank with a tiny wooden roof over it. The jeep has broken down.

You have no choice but to enter the village. From here you can reach the village road PROMENADE. ENTITY_DESCRIPTIONS
