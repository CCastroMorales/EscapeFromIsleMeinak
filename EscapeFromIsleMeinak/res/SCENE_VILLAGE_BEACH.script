scene.title EXT. VILLAGE BEACH - DAWN
scene.scriptBegin

The village beach is close to the harbor. It is one of many beaches on this island but the one closest to something that resembles civilization.

You can clearly see the main land from here. You can GO to the HARBOR or walk past the harbor to get to a BAR. You can also GO back up to the ROAD promenade.
