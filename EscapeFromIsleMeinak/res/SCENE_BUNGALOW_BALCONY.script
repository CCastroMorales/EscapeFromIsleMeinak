scene.title INT. BUNGALOW BALCONY - NIGHT
scene.scriptBegin

The full moon light illuminates the balcony. Even though it is hot outside the balcony tiles are chilly and slippery.

There is another bungalow nearby. You see a shadowy figure hunched over the other bungalow's balcony.

You can GO DOWN the stairs to get to the other bungalow or GO back INSIDE your own bungalow.
